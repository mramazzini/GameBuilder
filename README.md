## Features

## Getting Started

### Currently, there is no build system set up. If you wish to utilize the application, you must clone the repository and run the dev application locally.

After cloning the repo, you can run it locally with 

```npm install```

and 

```npm run develop```

### The Application will work without the engine, but if you wish to be able to run the engine with it, you must also acquire the neccessary files here -> [Maxy's C++ Game Engine](https://github.com/mramazzini/C-Game-engine)
